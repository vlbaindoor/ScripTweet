   <h3>Here are some guidelines (also known as Best Practices)</h3>
   <ul>
   <li>Twitter can be used as a tool to create a perception about your business</li>
   <li>One of the key aspects is NO message that goes out as a Tweet can be longer than 140 characters.</li>
   <li>When you gather followers for your own Twitter account, you would want them to Re-Tweet your tweets.
       When they do that your message goes further afield. But for your followers to Re-Tweet your Tweets,
       you need to follow certain best practices. One of them is simply the length of your message.
       If your message is shorter than about 120 characters then your followers would find it easier to
       add their own few characters and then Re-Tweet it.</li>
   <li>Any URL you wish to include in your message should better take up as few number of characters
       as possible. This is made easier by several URL Shortener services that are available. This
       utility uses the Google's URL Shortener tool. This Google tool has many advantages since you
       will be able to do Google Analytics on the URLs you used thus helping you decide which URL has
       given you better coverage or better engagement with your target.</li>
   <li>Due to the points mentioned above it is benefitial if your own message is shorter than
       100 characters.</li>
   </ul>
